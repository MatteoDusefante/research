\maketitle

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2010, defending a dissertation that discusses several complexity aspects in multi agent systems. The dissertation, entitled ``Complexity Analysis in Multi Agent Systems'', deals with the main theoretical aspects of the multi agent systems and some related complexity issues. While working on the thesis, I improved both my research skills and my theoretical background of algorithms and complexity. Besides this, during the three-year degree I took the foundation courses of information theory, algorithms and data structures.

During my Master of Science studies in computer science, I focused on advanced algorithms and complexity. More specifically, I took several courses aimed at improving my theoretical knowledge. The courses I enrolled to range from algorithms on strings and sequences to numerical algorithms. What is more, I completed my general knowledge of the subject by attending courses and laboratories covering logic programming, operations research and bioinformatics topics.

My fields of interest include

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Algorithms on strings and sequences, advanced algorithms, randomized algorithms}: String matching algorithms and algorithms on trees; Advanced data structures for patterns manipulation; Montecarlo and Las Vegas algorithms.
\item \emph{Complexity analysis over computational models and algorithms}: Abstract computational models; Computational classes, computational reductions and completeness; Bisimulation Theory.
\item \emph{Numerical algorithms and High Performance Computing}: Non linear equations and linear systems; Sparse Matrix Technologies; Approximation of data and functions, Fourier Transform; Differential equations and dynamical systems, Ordinary Differential Equation and Delay Differential Equation.
\item \emph{Logic programming and constraint programming}: Local search and Integer Linear Programming; Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization Problems; Constraint Programming and Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains; Answer Set Programming.
\end{itemize}

Besides the aforementioned theoretical subjects, during my whole university studies, I enforced my programming skills by developing several softwares. This led me to a good proficiency in a wide set of programming techniques and programming languages. In more detail, my programming languages of choice are Java and \CC/C. I developed in addition a number of tools in others programming languages, such as Python, Prolog, Haskell, Curry, Matlab.

My master thesis, entitled ``An integrated system for protein prediction'', is concerned with the development of an integrated system aimed at efficiently solving the protein structure prediction problem. More specifically, the dissertation provides a graphical user interface written in Java which in turn handles two constraint solvers written in \CC. While working on my master thesis I had the opportunity to work in a research team formed by several professors and Ph.D. students working at different Universities. I collaborated mainly with the Ph.D. student Federico Campeotto from the New Mexico State University and with prof. Alessandro Dal Pal√π from the University of Parma. My efforts culminated in the early release of the system being presented at the 10th Workshop on Constraint-Based Methods for Bioinformatics, in Lyon, France, on September 8th, 2014

\bigskip

During my graduate studies I intend to continue improving my theoretical knowledge and my programming skills. I hope I will be working in a team formed by scientists of heterogeneous backgrounds and will have the chance to face and possibly solve cutting edge algorithmic problems. I am aware my current skills have to be improved, although they cover the foundations of algorithms. Since many applicative problems tend to be multidisciplinary, I firmly believe that a graduate program should also improve the interpersonal skills of the researcher. To pursue all these objectives, I am willing to undertake my Ph.D. studies in an international program. The specifics of my future research are obviously undefined, but as a long term objective I can mention working in the field of advanced algorithms.
